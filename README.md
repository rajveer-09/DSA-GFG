GFG Solutions Repository
Welcome to my GFG solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from GFG. Each problem is organized in its own directory, and the solutions are implemented in a variety of programming languages.


Folder Structure
Each problem directory follows a similar structure:

README.md: Provides a brief description of the problem, its constraints, and the approach used to solve it.
Solution(s): Implementation of the solution in one or more programming languages.
Test Cases: Examples and additional test cases to validate the correctness of the solutions.
Programming Languages
I have solved these problems using various programming languages, including:

Python
Java
C++
JavaScript
Feel free to explore the solutions in the language of your choice!

Contributions
If you have a different or more optimized solution, I encourage you to contribute! Here's how you can do it:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b feature/new-solution.
Implement your solution and add test cases.
Commit your changes: git commit -m "Add new solution for Problem X".
Push to the branch: git push origin feature/new-solution.
Open a pull request.
I appreciate any contributions and feedback on the existing solutions.

Disclaimer
These solutions are my own work, and while I strive for accuracy, there may be better or more efficient solutions. Use these solutions as a reference and learning tool, and feel free to discuss alternative approaches.

Happy coding!
